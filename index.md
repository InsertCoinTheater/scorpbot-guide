ScorpBot is the ultimate bot for Mixer and Twitch - supporting both platforms at the same time.
In this guide, you will find complete documentation as to every feature and facet in ScorpBot,
from the Chat tab to the Web tab and everything in between.

You'll find each section in the list to the left (or the flyout menu if you're on mobile).

If you have any suggestions for this guide, please post on the ScorpBot Discord (link soon) or the [ScorpBot Forums](http://scorpbot.com/forums/) and let Scorpio know!
